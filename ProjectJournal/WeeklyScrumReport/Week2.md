### XP Core Values that kept throughout the project :
I kept the value of Simplicity throughout the project. I disintegrated complex items into small doable items. Prioritized the simple tasks to achieve the output. Example. I deployed Add card API into the docker containers and troubleshooted if any errors. Then followed to build on top of deploying each API.

### What tasks did I work on / complete?

I completed my part of Android application screens (Register User, Make an Order). 
I worked on the screen flow of our Android application and appearance.
I debugged our APIs if there are some issues or bugs. One I fixed was that when we added price, there were some junk values. I fixed it by changing formats.
I also tested the APIs deployed on AWS ECS with Android Application UI.

### What am I planning to work on next?

I will be working on mostly documentation regarding our project before the class of this week.

### XP Core Values that kept throughout the project:

Communication - Since it is a teamwork and I am integrating components with other team members, communicating among the team regarding issues and setups were significantly important. We had remote meetings frequently when we faced any issues. For example, I met Mojdeh more frequently than other team members because she and I worked on the Android application. We could solve any issues and keep syncing the structures on eachone's part. I could also find some issues about adding junk values in Order API named "Coffee" in the source code and fixed by communicating with Tommy.
