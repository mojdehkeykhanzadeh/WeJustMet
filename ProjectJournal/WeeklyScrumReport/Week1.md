### XP Core Values that kept throughout the project:

Feedback - We have a team with 4 memebers. Each member worked on an API independently, but stay connected. Thus, we could check each member's status and this will make our future integration much more efficiently. For example, we discussed about how each API works with other APIs and made suggestions for values to be shared.
